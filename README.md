I am Mubashir Iqbal, a Computer Science professional with a Master’s from COMSATS University Islamabad and a Bachelor’s from Virtual University Pakistan. Currently, I serve as a Lecturer at HITEC University, teaching and mentoring undergraduate students. My expertise includes AI, machine learning, data science, and software engineering, with a strong focus on system reliability and reusability. Passionate about eXplainable AI (XAI) to see how these AI blackbox model works. As a Software Engineer, I specialize in creating robust systems for both desktop and embedded environments using Qt C++. My skills also include Apache Server, PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Django, WordPress, and E-Commerce development, allowing me to effectively integrate and optimize systems. 

Looking forward to collaborating and making a meaningful impact!👨🏻‍ 👨🏻‍💻
